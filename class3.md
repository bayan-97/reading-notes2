# the list 
## order list 
``<ol>``
The ordered list is created with
the ``<ol> ``element.
``<li>``
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ``<li>`` tag
and a closing ``</li>`` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
## unorder list
  ``<ul>``
The unordered list is created
with the ``<ul>`` element.
``<li>``
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ``<li>`` tag
and a closing ``</li>`` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default.
## defition list
``<dl>``
The definition list is created with
the ``<dl>`` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the ``<dl>`` element you will
usually see pairs of ``<dt>`and
``<dd>`` elements.
``<dt>``
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
``<dd>``
This is used to contain the
definition.
Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
## Nested Lists
You can put a second list inside
an ``<li>`` element to create a sublist
or nested list.
``<ul>``
``<li>Mousses</li>``
``<li>Pastries``
``<ul>``
``<li>Croissant</li>``
``<li>Mille-feuille</li>``
``<li>Palmier</li>``
``<li>Profiterole</li>``
``</ul>``
``</li>``
``<li>Tarts</li>``
``</ul>``

# The CSS Box Model
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

 ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/970/0*5qeKw4RhW1BxgEMx.png)

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
## boxes height and width 
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
``p {``
``height: 75%;``
``width: 75%;``
``background-color: #0088dd;}``

Limiting Widt hmin-width, max-width
the
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide. 
``td.description {``
``min-width: 450px;``
``max-width: 650px;``
``text-align: left;``
``padding: 5px;``
``margin: 0px;}``
## overflow
hidden
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.
``p.one {``
``overflow: hidden}``
``p.two {``
``overflow: scroll;}``

**the border**
The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display.

The following values are allowed:

- dotted - Defines a dotted border
- dashed - Defines a dashed border
- solid - Defines a solid border
- double - Defines a double border
- groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- none - Defines no border
- hidden - Defines a hidden border
- The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
-`` p.dotted {border-style: dotted;}``
``p.dashed {border-style: dashed;}``
``p.solid {border-style: solid;}``
``p.double {border-style: double;}``
``p.groove {border-style: groove;}``
``p.ridge {border-style: ridge;}``
``p.inset {border-style: inset;}``
``p.outset {border-style: outset;}``
``p.none {border-style: none;}``
``p.hidden {border-style: hidden;}``
``p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;}``
## border color
You can specify the color of a
border using either RGB values,
hex codes or CSS color names
``border-top-color``
``border-bottom-color``
``border-left-color``

## Shorthand Property
to shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property.

The border property is a shorthand property :
``p {``
``width: 250px;``
``border: 3px dotted #0088dd;}``

## padding
The padding property allows
you to specify how much space
should appear between the
content of an element and its
border.
``padding: 50px;``
## margin
The margin property controls
the gap between boxes. Its value
is commonly given in pixels,
although you may also use
percentages or ems.
``margin: 20px;``

## Change Inline/Block
The display property allows
you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.
The values this property can
take are:
**inline**
This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.
**block**
This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element.
i**nline-block**
This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.
## hiddin box
The **visibility** property allows
you to hide boxes from users
but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.
This property can take two
values:
**hidden**
This hides the element.
**visible**
This shows the element.
If the visibility of an element
is set to hidden, a blank space
will appear in its place.
``li {``
``display: inline;``
``margin-right: 10px;}``
``li.coming-soon {``
``visibility: hidden;}``
## border-image
This property requires three
pieces of information:
1: The URL of the image
2: Where to slice the image
3: What to do with the straight
edges; the possible values are:
stretch stretches the image
repeat repeats the image
round like repeat.

  ## box shadow
  The box-shadow property
allows you to add a drop shadow
around a box. It works just like
the text-shadow property that
you met on page 288. It must
use at least the first of these two
values as well as a color:
Horizontal offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the left of the box.
Vertical offset
Negative values position the
shadow to the top of the box.
Blur distance
If omitted, the shadow is a solid
line like a border.
Sp read of shad ow
If used, a positive value will
cause the shadow to expand in
all directions, and a negative
value will make it contract.

 ## border-radius
 CSS3 introduces the ability to
create rounded corners on any
box, using a property called
border-radius. The value
indicates the size of the radius
in pixels.
``border-radius: 10px;``
``-moz-border-radius: 10px;``
``-webkit-border-radius: 10px;}``

## USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
if ... e 1 se statement al lows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false
``if (condition) {``
  ``//  block of code to be executed if the condition is true``
``} else {``
 `` //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false``
``}``
## switch
A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.
``switch(expression) {``
  ``case x:``
    ``// code block``
    ``break;``
  ``case y:``
   `` // code block``
    ``break;``
  ``default:``
    ``// code block``
``}``
# the loop

- ## loop by three ways :

1-  **for loop**  :*Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.*

**The for loop has the following syntax:**

**``for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {``**
**  ``// code block to be executed``**
**``}``**
- Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

- Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

- Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed**

2-**while loop**:*The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.*

**``while (condition) {``
  ``// code block to be executed``
``}``**

3-**USING DO WHILE LOOPS**:The key difference between
a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e
loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the
condition. This means that those
statements are run once whether
or not the condition is met.
``do {``
 `` // code block to be executed``
``}``
``while (condition);``
