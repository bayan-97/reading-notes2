## Storing Images onYourSite

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

*## Adding Images
``<img>`` images.html HTML
To add an image into the page
you need to use an ``<img>``
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
**src**
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see thatthe images are in a child folder
**alt**
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
**title**
You can also use the title
attribute with the ``<img>`` element to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

``<img src="images/quokka.`jpg" alt="A family of``
``quokka" title="The quokka ```is an Australian``
``marsupial that is similar ````in size to the``
``domestic cat." />``
## Height & Width of Images
- height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
- width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

``<img src="images/quokka.````jpg" alt="A family of``
``quokka" width="600" ````height="450" />``
## Where to Place Imagesin  Your Code
1- before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.

2- inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.

3- in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.

## Three Rules forCreating Images
1-
Save images in
the right format
Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.

2-
Save images at
the right size
You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to
display on the page.

3-
Use the correct
resolution
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.

There are several tools you can use to edit and
save images to ensure that they are the right
size, format, and resolution.
The most popular tool amongst
web professionals is **Adobe**
**Photoshop.**
## Image Di mensions
The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.
REDU CING IMAGE SIZE
You can reduce the size of
images to create a smaller
version of the image.
Example: If your image is 600
pixels wide and 300 pixels tall,
you can reduce the size of the
image by 50%.
Result: This will create an image
that is quicker to download.
INCREAS ING IMAGE SIZE
You can't increase the size of
photos significantly without
affecting the image quality.
Example: If your image is only
100 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall,

increasing the size by 300%
would result in poor quality.
Result: The image will look
blurry or blocky.
CHANG ING SHAPE
Only some images can be
cropped without losing valuable
information (see next page).
Example: If your image is 300
pixels square, you can remove
parts of it, but in doing so you
might lose valuable information.

Result: Only some images can
be cropped and still make sense.
## Cropping Images
When cropping images it is important not to
lose valuable information. It is best to source
images that are the correct shape if possible

## Image Resolution
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

## Vector Images
Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.
## Animated GIFs
Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

## Transparency
Creating an image that is partially transparent
(or "see-through") for the web involves
selecting one of two formats:
- Transparent GIF'
 If the transparent part of the
image has straight edges and
it is 100% transparent (that is,
not semi-opaque), you can save
the image as a GIF (with the
transparency option selected).
- PNG
If the transparent part of the
image has diagonal or rounded
edges or if you want a semiopaque
transparency or a dropshadow,
then you will need to
save it as a PNG.
## Examining Images on the Web
1-Checking the Si ze of Images
If you are updating a website, you might need to check the size of an
existing image before creating a new one to replace it. This can be
achieved by right-clicking on the image and making a selection from
the pop-up menu that appears. (Mac users will need to hold down the
control key and click rather than right-click.)
2- Downloading Images
If you want to download images from a website, you can do so by
accessing the same pop-up menu. (Please remember however that all
images online are subject to copyright and require explicit permission to
reuse.)
## HTML    5FigureandFigureCaption
``<figure>``
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new ``<figure>`` element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the ``<figure>``
element as long as they all share
the same caption.
``<figcaption>``

The ``<figcaption>`` element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an ``<img>`` element with
its caption.
``<figure>``
``<img src="images/otters.````jpg" alt="Photograph of``
``two sea otters floating in ````water">``
``<br />``
``<figcaption>Sea otters hold ````hands when they``
``sleep so they don't drift ````away from each``
``other.</figcaption>``
``</figure>``

# Search Engine Op timization (SEO )

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

1- In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

1: Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the ``<title>`` element which lives
inside the ``<head>`` element.

2: URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

3: Headings
If the keywords are in a heading
``<hn> ``element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

4: Text
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.

## How to Identify Keywords and Phrases

Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.


1: Brainstorm
List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.
It often helps to ask other people
what words they would use to
find your site because people
less familiar with a topic might
use different terms than you. (In
particular, they are less likely to
use industry-specific jargon.)
Your list may include some
keyword phrases (not just
individual words) if you have
topics which are described by
more than one word.

2: Organize
Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.
For example, if your website
was a pet shop you might have
different categories for different
animals (such as dogs, cats and
rabbits).
On a large site you may
break this up further into
sub-categories (for example,
separate groups for different pet
food brands).


3: Research
There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider, such as:
adwords.google.co.uk/
select/KeywordToolExternal
(When using this tool, select the
"exact match" option rather than
"broad match.")
www.wordtracker.com
www.keyworddiscovery.com
Once these tools have suggested
additional keywords, add the
relevant options to your lists.

(Keyword tools will most likely
suggest some terms that are
irrelevant so do omit any that do
not seem appropriate).


4: Compare
It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of

the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.
Some of the keyword research

sites can tell you how many
people have searched for a
specific keyword to help you
know how much competition
those terms have.
You can also use Google's

advanced search feature to
just search the titles of web
pages. This will help you to
determine how many sites have
that keyword in the title of their
pages. (The more pages with
the term in the title, the more
competition there is.)

5: Refine
Now you need to pick which

keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.
If there is a phrase that is very

relevant but you find there is a
lot of competition, you should
still use it. To improve the
chances of your site being found

you can look at whether there
are other words that could be
incorporated into a phrase. For
example, if the information or

service you offer on your website
is location specific, then you will
often find that incorporating
your location into your keyword

list will help people find you.
If your site is promoting a slate
roofing company in Australia
then it is better to get 100
people from Australia who are
looking for a slate roof than

10,000 from the USA who are
looking for other kinds of rooves

## Analytics: Learning about your VisitorsAt the

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.


- Signing Up
The Google Analytics service
relies on you signing up for an
account at:
www.google.com/analytics

The site will give you a piece of
tracking code which you need to
put on every page of your site.
- How it Works

Every time someone loads a
page of your site, the tracking
code sends data to the Google
servers where it is stored.

Google then provides a webbased
interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.
- The Tracking Code

A tracking code is provided
by Google Analytics for each
website you are tracking. It
should appear just before the
closing ``</head>`` tag. The code
does not alter the appearance of
your web pages.


## What Are Your Visitors Looking At?

The content link on the left-hand side allows
you to learn more about what the visitors are
looking at when they come to your site.

- Pages
This tells you which pages your
visitors are looking at the most
and also which pages they are
spending the most time on.

- Landing Pages
These are the pages that people
arrive on when first visiting your
site. This can be particularly
helpful because you may find
people are not always coming
into your site via the homepage.

- Top Exit Pages
This shows which pages people
most commonly leave from. If
a lot of people are leaving from
the same page then you might
consider changing that page or
improving it.

## Domain Names & Hosting
In order to put your site on the web you will
need a domain name and web hosting.

DOMAIN NAMES

Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.

These sites usually have a form
that allows you to check whether
your preferred domain name is
available, and because millions
of domain names have already
been registered, it might take
you a while to find the one that is
right for your site.

A lot of sites that offer domain
name registration also offer web
hosting.

- Web hosting
*So that other people can see*
*your site, you will need to uploa**d
*it to a web server. Web servers*
*are special computers that are*
*constantly connected to the*
*Internet. They are specially set*
*up to serve web pages when*
*they are requested.*

With the exception of some very
large sites, most websites live on
web servers run by web hosting
companies. This is usually far
cheaper and more reliable than
trying to run your own web
servers.

## FT P & Third Party Tools

To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer 
Protocol.


Here is a list of some popular
FTP applications:
**FileZilla**
filezilla-project.org
Windows, Mac, Linux
**FireFTP**
fireftp.mozdev.org
Windows, Mac, Linux
**CuteFTP**
cuteftp.com
Windows, Mac
**SmartFTP**
smartftp.com
WIndows
**Transmit**
panic.com



There are lots of different types
of hosting on offer. We will now
take a look at some of the key
things that will help you choose
which hosting company to use.

## HTML5 video and audio

The`` <video>`` and ``<audio>`` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content, a typical implementation looks like this:

``<video controls>``
  ``<source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">``
 `` <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">``
  ``<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a``
``href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>``
``</video>``

 can review what all the HTML features do in the article linked above; for our purposes here, the most interesting attribute is controls, which enables the default set of playback controls. If you don't specify this, you get no playback controls.

 ## The HTMLMediaElement API

 Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically — for example ``HTMLMediaElement.play()``,`` HTMLMediaElement.pause()``, etc. This interface is available to both ``<audio>`` and ``<video>`` elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. Let's go through an example, adding features as we go.

 ## Implementing the JavaScript

 We've got a fairly complete HTML and CSS interface already; now we just need to wire up all the buttons to get the controls working.

Create a new JavaScript file in the same directory level as your index.html file. Call it custom-player.js.

## Playing and pausing the video
Let's implement probably the most important control — the play/pause button.

First of all, add the following to the bottom of your code, so that the playPauseMedia() function is invoked when the play button is clicked:

``play.addEventListener('click', playPauseMedia);``

## Stopping the video

et's add functionality to handle stopping the video. Add the following ``addEventListener()`` lines below the previous one you added:

``stop.addEventListener('click', stopMedia);``
``media.addEventListener('ended', stopMedia);``


The click event is obvious — we want to stop the video by running our stopMedia() function when the stop button is clicked. We do however also want to stop the video when it finishes playing — this is marked by the ended event firing, so we also set up a listener to run the function on that event firing too.

 let's define stopMedia() — add the following function below ``
 playPauseMedia():

``function stopMedia() {``
  ``media.pause();``
  ``media.currentTime = 0;``
  ``play.setAttribute('data-icon','P');``
``}``

there is no stop() method on the HTMLMediaElement API — the equivalent is to pause() the video, and set its currentTime property to 0. Setting currentTime to a value (in seconds) immediately jumps the media to that position.

All there is left to do after that is to set the displayed icon to the "play" icon. Regardless of whether the video was paused or playing when the stop button is pressed, you want it to be ready to play afterwards.
