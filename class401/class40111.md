## Readings:Readings: Authentication

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
In object-oriented programming , a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. 
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".

## Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function 

Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions, designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible. Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.

### PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM


- Brute Force attack: Hashes can't be reversed, so instead of reversing the hash of the password, an attacker can simply keep trying different inputs until he does not find the right now that generates the same hash value, called brute force attack.

- Hash Collision attack: Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash. MD5, SHA1, SHA2 are vulnerable to Hash Collision Attack i.e. two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result.

## Basic access authentication


password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon .

### Protocol


1. Server side
When the server wants the user agent to authenticate itself towards the server, the server must respond appropriately to unauthenticated requests.

To unauthenticated requests, the server should return a response whose header contains a HTTP 401 Unauthorized status and a WWW-Authenticate field.

The WWW-Authenticate field for basic authentication is constructed as following:

WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="User Visible Realm"

The server may choose to include the charset parameter from RFC 7617

WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="User Visible Realm", charset="UTF-8"

This parameter indicates that the server expects the client to use UTF-8 for encoding username and password .

2. Client side
When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the Authorization field.

The Authorization field is constructed as follows

- The username and password are combined with a single colon (:). This means that the username itself cannot contain a colon.
- The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence. The character set to use for this encoding is by default unspecified, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII, but the server may suggest use of UTF-8 by sending the charset parameter.[7]
- The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64.
- The authorization method and a space (e.g. "Basic ") is then prepended to the encoded string.1
# JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

- JSON Web Tokens are useful:

- Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

- Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.


## the JSON Web Token structure

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

`{`
 ` "alg": "HS256",`
  `"typ": "JWT"`
`}`

- Payload
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
`{`
`  "sub": "1234567890",`
`  "name": "John Doe",`
`  "admin": true`
`}`
- Signature
To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

`HMACSHA256(`
`  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +`
`  base64UrlEncode(payload),`
`  secret)`

## JSON Web Tokens work

![](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/media/articles/api-auth/client-credentials-grant.png)

1. the application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the different 2. authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application will go through the /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.
3. When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.
The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).
