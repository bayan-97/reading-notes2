## Workings of `setState()`

`setState() `is the only legitimate way to update state after the initial state setup. Let’s say we have a search component and want to display the search term a user submits.

## assing a Function to `setState()`

`handleIncrement = () => {`
`  this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })`
 ` this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })`
  `this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })`
`}`

`handleDecrement = () => {`
`  this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })`
 ` this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })`
 ` this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })`
`}`
## Access Previous State Using Updater


When building React applications, there are times when you’ll want to calculate state based the component’s previous state. You cannot always trust this.state to hold the correct state immediately after calling `setState()`, as it is always equal to the state rendered on the screen.


`changeCount = () => {`
  `this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1})`
`}`



## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

1. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

2. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

`<button onClick={activateLasers}>`
`  Activate Lasers`
`</button>`

## form 
HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

`  render() {`
   ` return (`
      `<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>`
        `<label>`
       ``   Name:``
        `  <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange=``{this.handleChange} />`
        `</label>`
        `<input type="submit" value="Submit" />`
     ` </form>`
   ` );`
  `}`

  ## State and Lifecycle
Converting a Function to a Class
You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
Add a single empty method to it called render().
Move the body of the function into the render() method.
Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
Delete the remaining empty function declaration.


`class Clock extends React.Component {`
 ` render() {`
    `return (`
      `<div>`
        `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`
        `<h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>`
      `</div>`
   ` )``;`
  `}`
`}`

## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.

`class Clock extends React.Component {`
 ` constructor(props) {`
   ` super(props);`
    `this.state = {date: new Date()}`;
  `}`

 ` componentDidMount() {`
  `}`

 ` componentWillUnmount() {`
  `}`

  `render() {`
   ` return (`
      <`div>`
        <`h1>Hello, world!</h1>`
       ` <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>`
     ` </div>`
    `);`
 ` }`
`}`




## State Updates May Be Asynchronous
React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.

Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

`this.setState(function(state, props) {`
  `return {`
    `counter: state.counter + props.increment`
  `};`
`});`

## Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

`function Welcome(props) {`
  `return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;`
`}`

## Composing Components
Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

`function Welcome(props) {`
 ` return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;`
`}`

`function App() {`
 ` return (`
    `<div>`
     ` <Welcome name="Sara" />`
      `<Welcome name="Cahal" />`
     ` <Welcome name="Edite" />`
    `</div>`
  `);`
`}`

`ReactDOM.render(`
  `<App />,`
  `document.getElementById('root')`
`);`
