## Readings:Readings:Bearer Authorization


Write the following steps in the correct order:
Receive access token
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint
What can you do with an authorization code?
- An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes - its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter - - - - - information into a security-protected space. An authorization code is typically a sequence of letters, numbers, or a combination of - both, that validates a person's identity, approves a transaction or provides access to a secured area.
What can you do with an access token?
What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.

# JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

- JSON Web Tokens are useful:

- Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

- Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.


## the JSON Web Token structure

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

`{`
 ` "alg": "HS256",`
  `"typ": "JWT"`
`}`

- Payload
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
`{`
`  "sub": "1234567890",`
`  "name": "John Doe",`
`  "admin": true`
`}`
- Signature
To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

`HMACSHA256(`
`  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +`
`  base64UrlEncode(payload),`
`  secret)`

## JSON Web Tokens work

![](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/media/articles/api-auth/client-credentials-grant.png)

1. the application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the different 2. authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application will go through the /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.
3. When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.
The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).
