##  The Component Lifecycle
By far the most important concept on this list is understanding the component lifecycle. The component lifecycle is exactly what it sounds like: it details the life of a component. Like us, components are born, do some things during their time here on earth, and then they die ☹.

## Mounting
Since class-based components are classes, hence the name, the first method that runs is the constructor method. Typically, the constructor is where you would initialize component state.

Next, the component runs the getDerivedStateFromProps. I’m going to skip this method since it has limited use.

Now we come to the render method which returns your JSX. Now React “mounts” onto the DOM.

Lastly, the componentDidMount method runs. Here is where you would do any asynchronous calls to databases or directly manipulate the DOM if you need. Just like that, our component is born.

## Updating
This phase is triggered every time state or props change. Like in mounting, getDerivedStateFromProps is called (but no constructor this time!).

Next shouldComponentUpdate runs. Here you can compare old props/state with the new set of props/state. You can determine if your component should re-render or not by returning true or false. This can make your web app more efficient by cutting down on extra re-renders. If shouldComponentUpdate returns false, this update cycle ends.

If not, React re-renders and getSnapshotBeforeUpdate runs afterwards. This method has limited use as well. React then runs componentDidUpdate. Like componentDidMount you can use it to make any async calls or manipulate the DOM.
## props.children

The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.

## A simple example
Here’s an example of a stateless function that is used to create a component. Again, since this is a stateless function, there is no 'this' keyword so just use props.children.
`const Picture = (props) => {`
  `return (`
    `<div>`
      `<img src={props.src}/>`
      `{props.children}`
    `</div>`
  `)`
`}`
## Composition vs Inheritance
React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components
