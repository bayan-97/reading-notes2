## The core idea
State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those.

## MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

First of all, there is the application state. Graphs of objects, arrays, primitives, references that forms the model of your application. These values are the “data cells” of your application.
Secondly there are derivations. Basically, any value that can be computed automatically from the state of your application. These derivations, or computed values, can range from simple values, like the number of unfinished todos, to complex stuff like a visual HTML representation of your todos. In spreadsheet terms: these are the formulas and charts of your application.
Reactions are very similar to derivations. The main difference is these functions don't produce a value. Instead, they run automatically to perform some task. Usually this is I/O related. They make sure that the DOM is updated or that network requests are made automatically at the right time.
Finally there are actions. Actions are all the things that alter the state. MobX will make sure that all changes to the application state caused by your actions are automatically processed by all derivations and reactions. Synchronously and glitch-free.

## A simple todo store...
Enough theory, seeing it in action probably explains more than carefully reading the above stuff. For originality's sake let's start with a very simple ToDo store. Note that all the code blocks below are editable, So use the run code buttons to execute them. Below is a very straightforward TodoStore that maintains a collection of todos. No MobX involved yet.


## Becoming reactive
So far, there is nothing special about this code. But what if we didn't have to call report explicitly, but that we could declare instead that it should be invoked upon each relevant state change? That would free us from the responsibility of calling report from any place in our code base that might affect the report. We do want to be sure the latest report is printed. But we don't wanna be bothered by organizing that.


Luckily that is exactly what MobX can do for us. Automatically execute code that solely depends on state. So that our report function updates automatically, just like a chart in a spreadsheet. To achieve that, the TodoStore has to become observable so that MobX can track all the changes that are being made. Let's alter the class just enough to achieve that.

## Making React reactive
Ok, so far we made a silly report reactive. Time to build a reactive user interface around this very same store. React components are (despite their name) not reactive out of the box. The observer HoC wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package fixes that by basically wrapping the React component in autorun. To automatically keep components in sync with the state. This is conceptually not different from what we did with the report before.

The next listing defines a few React components. The only MobX specific code in there is the observer wrapping. That is enough to make sure that each component individually re-renders when relevant data changes. We don't have to call state useState setters anymore, nor do we have to figure out how to subscribe to the proper parts of the application state using selectors or higher order components that need configuration. Basically, all components have become smart. Yet they are defined in a dumb, declarative manner.
