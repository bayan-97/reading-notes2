The web framework
The first goal is to set up a simple HTML webpage that serves out a form and a list of messages. We’re going to use the Node.JS web framework express to this end. Make sure Node.JS is installed.

`npm install express@4.15.2`


Within each Namespace, you can define arbitrary channels called “Rooms” that sockets can join and leave.

This is useful to broadcast data to a subset of sockets:
![](https://socket.io/images/rooms.png)

`io.on('connection', socket => {`
`  socket.join('some room');`
`});`



Default room
Each Socket in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier Socket#id. For your convenience, each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.


Disconnection
Upon disconnection, sockets leave all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.
