## tree

 Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

##  Common Terminology

- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversals
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time:

Our output using breadth first traversal is now:

Output: **A, B, C, D, E, F**

Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. Letâ€™s break down the process.
