What is the OSI model?
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It’s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.


Although the modern Internet doesn’t strictly follow the OSI model (it more closely follows the simpler Internet protocol suite), the OSI model is still very useful for troubleshooting network problems. Whether it’s one person who can’t get their laptop on the Internet, or a web site being down for thousands of users, the OSI model can help to break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble. If the problem can be narrowed down to one specific layer of the model, a lot of unnecessary work can be avoided.

7. The Application Layer
This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables email communications).
6. The Presentation Layer
This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.

Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.

5. The Session Layer
This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**How Transmission Control Protocol works??**

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. It determines how to break application data into packets that networks can deliver, sends packets to and accepts packets from the network layer, manages flow control and -- because it is meant to provide error-free data transmission -- handles retransmission of dropped or garbled packets and acknowledges all packets that arrive. In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model, TCP covers parts of Layer 4, the transport layer, and parts of Layer 5, the session layer.

**What TCP is used for??**
TCP is used for organizing data in a way that ensures the secure transmission between the server and client. It guarantees the integrity of data sent over the network, regardless of the amount. For this reason, it is used to transmit data from other higher-level protocols that require all transmitted data to arrive. Examples include:

Secure Shell (SSH), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet: For peer-to-peer file sharing, and, in Telnet's case, logging into another user's computer to access a file.
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): For sending and receiving email
HTTP: For web access
