# Embedded Javascript Templating(EJS)


Ejs is a templating language that can be used in Node.js as a templating engine. There are many other templating engines like pug and handlebars, but ejs is very easy to learn and work with. It uses simple vanilla javascript. 

JSON is used to inject data into the template and generate dynamic HTML content.

``INSTALLING EJS IN NODE.JS``
``npm install ejs --save``

The above command is used to install ejs to your node project. “npm” is the node package manager that is used to install all node dependencies.
## SETTING EJS AS A TEMPLATING ENGINE

``const express = require(‘express’);``
``const app = express();``
``app.set(‘view engine’, ‘ejs’);``

## Express is used as a web-app framework. Views folder in your project is browsed for templates by default.

`app.set('views','temp');`

If you have stored your templates in a folder other than the views folder, say temp folder then you can set it by adding the above statement.

## SETTING UP THE FILE


`.ejs `is the file extension. You do not need to change the structure of your HTML code, you can simply copy it and paste it in`.ejs` file.

``app.get(‘main’,(req , res, next) => {``
``res.render(“main”);``
``});``

In the above middleware, main.ejs file will be rendered for the`` ‘/main’ ``route. Specifying the file extension is not necessary because we have set the templating engine to ejs.

## DYNAMIC CONTENT IN EJS


Whenever you want to add dynamic content while rendering, you pass a JSON object as a parameter. 

The variables you pass and the variable used in an ejs file must be the same.
Any javascript code used in ejs is enclosed with <% %>.

 If you want to add a variable named ‘var1’, the syntax would be the following:

`` <% =var1 %>``

## HTML CONTENT AFTER RENDERING:


“This is main page” replaces the position were the variable var1 was present.

## LOOPING IN EJS

There are different types of looping in ejs. It can either be a simple for loop or a for-of loop. 

A for-of loop is more suited for traversing through the results of database retrieval.

For loop


``Router.get(‘/main’,(req,res,next) => {``
``res.render(‘main’,{``
``var1: “Printing Numbers”,``
``n: 6``
``});``
``});``

## HTML CONTENT AFTER RENDERING:

``’n’`` takes the value 6 which caused the loop to execute 6 times.


## Advanced Layouts

Currently, EJS doesn't support the ability to have layouts. So far we have just brought in other partials, but not really used layouts the way we would expect templating to work (extending a layout file and passing a view file into that). 

There have been projects in the past to try to bring templating to EJS. The two main projects are EJS Locals and EJS Express Layouts.

 These provide the ability to define different layouts like a sidebar layout and a full width layout and then call those on the fly. 


 # Conclusion


EJS let's us spin up quick applications when we don't need anything too complex. 

By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.
