# EJS Partials

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views

Our blog will consist of a home page which lists all the blog posts and a post page which will display a single post. Our home page will look like so

the post page:

- from the screenshots above, the same navigation bar and footer appear in both the home and post view. This makes them perfect candidates for partials!

<!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
   `` <div class="header clearfix">``
        ``<nav>``
            ``<ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">``
               `` <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>``
            ``</ul>``
           `` <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>``
       `` </nav>``
   `` </div>``

    create those partials. Under the views/partials/ directory create a file callednavbar.ejs which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages.

    Now that we have our partials defined, we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates! In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).


Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.


- create the homepage template in views/home.ejs and include the navbar and footer partial we just created


``<div class="container">``
           `` <%- include('partials/navbar') %>``
           `` <div class="jumbotron">``
                ``<h1>All about Node</h1>``
                ``<p class="lead">Check out our articles below!</p>``
            ``</div>``





- As you can see creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS. Iâ€™ve intentionally left in some placeholders such as LIST_OF_POSTS, POST_TITLE, POST_AUTHOR, and POST_CONTENT so that we can take a look at how we can pass data from our Node + Express application to our views in the next section.
